# Express API with JSON-Server and JWT Authentication

This project is an example of a simple RESTful API built with `json-server` to serve JSON data and JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication. The API is built using Express and can be used as a boilerplate for building and securing API endpoints. Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete posts.

## Features

- **JSON-Server:** Quickly create a mock REST API for prototyping and testing.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure API endpoints using JWT for user authentication.
- **Express:** Lightweight framework for creating server-side applications.
- **Post Management:** Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete posts.
